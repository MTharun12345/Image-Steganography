A FRAMEWORK OF MUILT-LAYER IMAGE STEGANOGRAPHY
Steganography hides sensitive data within ordinary files, making it undetectable and enhancing security when 
paired with encryption. This project develops a tool using Visual Studio and Python to embed and extract hidden 
messages in media files like images. The goal is to enable covert communication without arousing suspicion, 
even in environments restricting encryption. Digital steganography is growing in use, but advancements in 
steganalysis pose ongoing challenges.
